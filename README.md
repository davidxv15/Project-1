Memory Matcher 

User is presented with a game board of nondescript vinyl records
outside of their storage sleeves, obscuring their respective album jackets.
Each album jacket image is shared by only one other record.
User will select one record at a time, revealing it's jacket's image
while attempting to memorize said image and it's position 
on the board.
User's goal is to select each matching pair of records in
succession, until all record jackets have been revealed, 
thus completing play.

Technoligies used: Javascript, HTML, CSS, PhotoShop.

Getting started:

Next steps: I plan on creating a bigger board, adding album art as the uncovered image, and music clips from the record that the image is referencing to play when the curser is hovering over each record for a visually impaired user feature. The music clips are necessary for visually impaired feature.
